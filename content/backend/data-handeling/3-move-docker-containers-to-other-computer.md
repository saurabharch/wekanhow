This page is work in progress, and needs more details.

1) If you have installed Wekan with Docker like at this page:

https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Export-Docker-Mongo-Data

2) and you want to move Docker containers to another computer (laptop, server etc) that also has Docker installed, use Docker export and import commands:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/export/

https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/import/

3) If mongo data is on volume, also use this:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/#backup-restore-or-migrate-data-volumes
