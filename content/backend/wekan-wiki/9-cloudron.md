# Cloudron setup

For those unaware,  Cloudron is a complete solution for running apps on your server and keeping them up-to-date and secure.

1. First install Cloudron on your server with 3 simple commands - https://cloudron.io/get.html
2. Install Wekan from the Cloudron Store. Once installed, you will get automatic updates for Wekan as and when they get released.

Cloudron's wekan package is integrated with Cloudron's LDAP.

The source code for the package can be found [here](https://git.cloudron.io/cloudron/wekan-app/).

You can also test the wekan installation on the demo Cloudron instance - https://my-demo.cloudron.me (username: cloudron password: cloudron).
